# Roll20-Dark(er)-Theme
Dark theme for Roll20. Fully compatible with the base editor as well as the 5e Shaped and OGL sheets.
Also compatible with the VTT Enhancement Suite (formerly Roll20 Enhancement Suite) extension!

Edited to be a UserStyle rather than a UserScript with the ability to customize the accent color
